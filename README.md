Blog Summary
---------------
The analysis below identifies a number of miRNA and miRNA clusters (e.g. let-7a/let-7b/miR-4763) that are predicted to target different regions of SARS-CoV-2.  Further work is needed to validate experimentally if the activation of these miRNA can prevent or slow down the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and help with the COVID-19 pandemic.  Of note is that let-7b was previously (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22391672/) shown to be a novel regulator of Hep C virus replication.
